Lesson plans have been converted to Jupyter Notebooks.

# Starting up jupyter notebook
- In a terminal window run `jupyter notebook`
- This should bring up a browser that points to this URL: `http://localhost:8888/tree#`
- Go to `minecraft/notebook/` and click on `Introduction.ipynb` to start coding!

# Installation
- Should not be required if already using a pre-build sd card.
- `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
- `sudo pip install jupyter` to install jupyter notebook
